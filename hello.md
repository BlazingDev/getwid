Hello!

I wanted to contact you but as I did not find any other contact data this seems to be my last option.

I saw your repository which seems like it's only there to reserve the name.
Surprisingly I thought of the same name when I wanted to create my github account yesterday - then I found out that you already took it.
Now I wanted to ask if you mind to release this Github name? Because I wanted to start my "open source journey" with some non-personal name and BlazingDev sounded quite good for me for that case :)

Would be great if you are still active/reachable and if you answer this type of contacting :) 

BR, David
